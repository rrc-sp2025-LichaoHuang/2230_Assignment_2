Can I explain what my code does?

My code creates a resume website using HTML and CSS. CSS defines the visual style, including colors, fonts, layout, and interactive effects like hover transitions on images and navigation links. Media queries make the website responsive, ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.

Describe the functionality of your code and its components. How do your code segments work together to meet the project's objectives?
What was my coding process?
Following the project workflow for the assignment, I wrote the CSS for my website, from header to footer. I selected a color scheme and fonts to create a unified and aesthetically pleasing page. I used Flexbox and some hover effects to bring the page to life. I also wrote media queries to adjust the layout, font size, and image size for screens under 600px.

What challenges did I have?

Hover effects not working initially: The navigation links and skill images did not scale as expected. I solved this by adding transition properties to enable smooth transformations.

What would I do differently now?

Given what you have learned through this project, what changes would you make to your approach or your code if you were to start over?

I will finish my assignments early so that I can mark them online in class on Thursday.
